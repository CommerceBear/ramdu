## Getting started

Ramdu has some goals:

- To be lightweight
- To use only pure functions with a general purpose
- To export currified versions of all functions
- To look like original Ramda as much as possible

### [Documentation](https://jmlweb.github.io/ramdu/)

```sh
yarn add ramdu
# or
npm install ramdu
```
